# barebonesExam

**This is just code requested by an exam.** It is basically an example of a working CRUD app.

##Restrictions are as follows:

 - Library to use is only Mysql, EJS, and Express.

 - Create a RESTful API that can return JSON or consume API call.

 - Must be uploaded in Github with iterative commits.

##Miscellaneous details (that are possibly important to reconstruct the app) from the developer of this app as follows:

 - This was created in Arch Linux, running mysql57 from the AUR

 - mysqld and other installation files from the package are untouched. Everything is installed in their default locations.

 - mysql account is root@localhost with password "1234567890" (no quotes)

 - IDE is Atom with several packages installed

 - Most code is borrowed or based on the references below.
